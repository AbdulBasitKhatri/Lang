# Lang
Hey ! this is my open source project and i made my own language lexer, parser and interpreter in C++
This language supports syntax like lua , python and javascript! The main purpose of developing this kind of language is just to combine the different language flavors and their syntaxes to make it more flexible!
I just made this by my own but yet its not compeleted!
Its a handy and fast interpreting language, ready to run on any platform : Windows , MacOS and Linux.
