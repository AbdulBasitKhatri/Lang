# Lang
Hey ! this is my open source project and i made my own language lexer, parser and interpreter in C++
This language supports syntax like lua , python and javascript! The main purpose of developing this kind of language is just to combine the different language flavors and their syntaxes to make it more flexible!
I just made this by my own but yet its not compeleted!
Its a handy and fast interpreting language, ready to run on any platform : Windows , MacOS and Linux.

# Usage
First compile the all the source files after that make a file name "code.lang" in the directory/folder where your compiled binary/executable is present!
I've written the example code in the file present in the main branch named "code.lang" refer to that to see the example code!
